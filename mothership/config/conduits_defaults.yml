# Conduits default capabilities (Phase 0/1 scaffolding).
#
# This file defines server-side defaults used when a directive omits a capability.
# Long-term, effective capabilities should be computed by Policy (global/account/user/facility),
# and sandbox drivers must enforce them.
#
# Conventions:
# - "workspace:**" means "within the facility workspace mount".
# - Untrusted defaults are intentionally strict (workspace-only).
